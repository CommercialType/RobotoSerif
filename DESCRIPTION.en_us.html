Roboto Serif is a serif typeface designed to work alongside Roboto for interfaces and immersive reading, commissioned by Google from Commercial Type.
Designed from the ground up as a variable font, Roboto Serif features a full range of weights, widths from condensed to extended, and optical sizes from micro to large display.
It also includes a grade axis to fine tune contrast for different usages without affecting line breaks and copyfit.

This family supports the Google Fonts Latin Pro glyph set, for use in over 130 languages including Vietnamese.
