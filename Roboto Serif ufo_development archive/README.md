# About These Fonts

These files show periodic, mile-marker updates to the fonts as they were being created.
Over the course of this project many ideas were tested to see if they improved the overall font. 
By the end of 2018 the vision of the font was mostly solidified, and the designers went to work on fleshing out the glyph sets. 
These sources are in the Roboto Serif UFO directory.
